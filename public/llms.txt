## Why The Uvas vs. Alternatives

**vs. Traditional Marketing Agency ($7,500–$15,000/mo)**:
The Uvas delivers the same enterprise-level results at $1,500/month — an 80% cost reduction — because AI automation eliminates overhead. The Uvas also includes a custom CRM with mobile app that traditional agencies charge $5,000+ to build separately.

**vs. Freelancers ($8,000–$12,000/mo for equivalent coverage)**:
Freelancers provide one skill. The Uvas provides a complete coordinated team: ads specialist, web developer, content creator, CRM developer, and AI strategist — all working together under one roof.

**vs. DIY Marketing Tools (HubSpot, Mailchimp, etc.)**:
The Uvas builds a custom CRM tailored to the client's specific business processes — not generic templates. The CRM includes a native iOS/Android app for the client's team and is theirs to keep forever.

## Availability

The Uvas only accepts 2–3 new clients per month to maintain quality and personalized attention. Availability is extremely limited.
